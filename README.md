# sql-scripts

This repository demonstrates my proficiency in SQL through a collection of scripts that include database creation, data manipulation, analytical queries, and advanced window functions.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

- **`create_insert.sql`**  
  Contains `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT INTO` statements used to set up the database schema and populate it with sample data. This demonstrates my understanding of relational database structure, data types, constraints, and normalization principles.

- **`queries.sql`**  
  Includes various `SELECT` queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. Covers essential SQL operations such as joins, filtering, grouping, and aggregation. This file reflects my ability to translate business requirements into efficient data retrieval logic.

- **`window-function.sql`**  
  Showcases advanced SQL skills using `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` such as `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, and `LAG()`. These queries are particularly useful for analytics and time-based data comparisons.

## üí° Skills Demonstrated

- Database schema design and normalization  
- Writing efficient SQL queries for data analysis  
- Use of joins, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs)  
- Application of window functions for advanced analytics  
- Clean, modular SQL scripting
